# Focus analysis application

Our goal in the focus analysis app is to help any presenter to analyze the state of the audience by calculating percentage that indicates the concentration of each attendant and allow presenter to give a directory containing recorded videos for attendants and have summary about each video and about the average concentration of all attendants , also we added feature that user of this app can open the live camera and start testing their concentration.
